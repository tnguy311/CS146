The stability of a sorting algorithm keeps the order of equal elements in the input array intact after sorting.
If there are two equal elements in the original array, a stable sorting algorithm would help make them they stay in the same order in the sorted array.

Stability is useful because it:
Helps maintain the original order of data, which can be important in various applications.
Makes sorting by multiple criteria more predictable.
Ensures consistent behavior across different runs of the algorithm.

If a sorting algorithm isn't stable, it may:
Rearrange equal elements, leading to unexpected output.
Produce inconsistent results based on factors like input order or algorithm details.
